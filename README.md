# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Customer Segmentation Analysis** project uses clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behaviors and demographic data. The goal of this project is to enable targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement by understanding distinct customer groups.

## Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
- Apply clustering algorithms to segment customers into meaningful groups.
- Visualize and interpret each customer segment to identify actionable insights.
- Deliver insights for enhancing personalized marketing efforts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and visualization
- **SQL**: To extract and process data from relational databases

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information including demographic details, purchasing behavior, and spending patterns. Example columns may include:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Income`: Customer's annual income
- `SpendingScore`: Score based on customer spending patterns
- `PurchaseFrequency`: Frequency of purchases in a specific period

*Note*: This dataset can be modified or extended based on the available data.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and data standardization.
   - Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyzing the distribution of demographic data and purchasing patterns.
   - Creating visualizations to understand relationships between key variables.

3. **Customer Segmentation with Clustering**:  
   - Applying K-Means and DBSCAN clustering to identify customer segments.
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

4. **Results Interpretation and Visualization**:  
   - Analyzing each segment to determine common characteristics.
   - Visualizing clusters with demographic and purchasing behavior data.

## Results and Visualizations
Key visualizations include:
- **Cluster Profiles**: Visual representation of each segmentâ€™s characteristics (e.g., income, age, spending score).
- **Demographic Insights**: Distribution charts for age, income, and spending score across clusters.
- **Purchase Behavior**: Comparison of purchase frequency and spending scores across segments.

These visualizations help in understanding customer profiles and targeting strategies effectively.
